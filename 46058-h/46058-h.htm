<span class="fontsmall">SOURCES OF SENECAN INFLUENCE ON ENGLISH
DRAMA</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> interest of English students in the dramas
of Seneca lies in the powerful influence exerted by
them upon the evolution of the English drama,
and these translations have been undertaken in
the hope that they may be found useful to English
students of English drama.</p>

<p>Though all the tragedies ascribed to Seneca are
not by the same hand, yet they are so far homogeneous
that in considering them as a literary influence,
one is not inclined to quarrel with the
classification that unites them under a single name.
For the present purpose, therefore, no time need
be spent in the discussion of their authorship or
exact date, but we may turn at once to look for
their appearance as agents in the development of
the modern, serious drama. In this relation it is
hardly possible to overestimate their determining
influence throughout Europe. Perhaps it may
have been owing to the closer racial bond between
the Romans and the French that while the Senecan
influence upon the drama in France was so
overmastering and tyrannical, in England the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_x" title="x"> </a>
native spirit was stronger to resist it, and the
English drama at its best remained distinctively
English, the influence exercised over it by the
Senecan tragedies being rather formative than
dominant.</p>

<p>Before the time of Marlowe and Shakespeare
the forces that determined the development of
the serious drama in England were practically
twofold: one native, emanating from the moralities
and miracle plays; the other classic, and found
in the tragedies long ascribed to Seneca. These
remnants of the Roman drama were known to the
English at a very early date, were valued by the
learned as the embodiment of what was best in
ancient art and thought, and were studied in the
Latin originals by pupils in the schools even
while the schools were still wholly monastic.
During the latter half of the sixteenth century,
separate plays of Seneca were translated into English
by various authors, and in 1581 Thomas
Newton collected these translations into one
volume, under the title of "Seneca his Ten
Tragedies, Translated into English." After an
examination of these translations one can readily
understand why Elizabeth felt the need of an
English translation of the Latin favorite, and herself
essayed to turn them into English verse. In
1702 Sir Edward Sherburne published translations
of three of the plays, but the edition of 1581
still remains the only complete English translation.
From the edition of 1581 I quote a part<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xi" title="xi"> </a>
of the translation of the beautiful lines on the
future life, Troades, Act II., Scene iv.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"May this be true, or doth the Fable fayne,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When corps is deade the Sprite to live as yet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Death our eies with heavy hand doth strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And fatall day our leames of light hath shet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the Tombe our ashes once be sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hath not the soule likewyse his funerall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But stil (alas) do wretches live in thrall?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Or els doth all at once togeather die?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And may no part his fatal howre delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with the breath the Soule from hence doth flie?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And eke the Cloudes to vanish quite awaye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As danky shade fleeth from the poale by day?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And may no iote escape from desteny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When once the brand hath burned the body?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Sherburne's translation of 1702 the same
lines are rendered as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Is it a Truth? or Fiction blinds<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Our fearful Minds?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That when to Earth we Bodies give,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Souls yet do live?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That when the Wife hath clos'd with Cries<br /></span>
<span class="i8">The Husband's Eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the last fatal Day of Light,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Hath spoil'd our Sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when to Dust and Ashes turn'd<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Our Bones are urn'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Souls stand yet in nead at all<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But that a longer Life with Pain<br /></span>
<span class="i8">They still retain?<br /></span>

<span class="i8">Survives the Grave?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When like to Smoake immixed with skies,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">Or setting shows," etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_xii" title="xii"> </a>
It is also interesting to compare Sherburne's
version with the earlier one in the famous passage
which closes the chorus at the end of the second
act of the Medea; Newton's edition gives the
lines as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now seas controulde doe suffer passage free,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Argo proude erected by the hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pallas first, doth not complayne that shee,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some travelers shall the Countreys farre escrye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beyonde small Thule, knowen furthest at this day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As given by Sherburne these lines are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"The passive Main<br /></span>

</div></div>

That the influence of Seneca's plays upon the
English stage came very directly may be seen from
the facts known concerning their long popularity,
and the consideration in which they were held as
literature, whether in the original or in translation.
But their influence was exerted not only by direct
means; the revival of learning in Europe brought
with it a general revival of the Latin influence,
and England in borrowing from Italy and France
borrowed indirectly from Rome. Among the
English translations made in the time of Elizabeth
from French and Italian authors, we find
the names of dramas modelled closely after Seneca,
and intended in their English dress for presentation
on the English stage; thus indirectly also
was Senecan style and thought perpetuated in the
English drama.</p>

<h3 class="nopage"><a name="TENDENCIES" id="TENDENCIES"></a>II<br />
<span class="fontsmall">TENDENCIES OF SENECAN INFLUENCE AS FELT BY
ENGLISH DRAMA</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would hardly be possible to find a stronger
contrast than that between these Senecan tragedies
and the early English drama as it existed in
moralities and miracle plays before the classic
influence made itself felt. With perhaps the
single exception of "The Sacrifice of Isaac,"
which in its touching simplicity is truly dramatic,
the moralities and miracle plays are little more
than vivid narrative in which events of equal<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xiv" title="xiv"> </a>
magnitude follow one another in epic profusion;
the classic unities of time and place are unknown,
and, so far as unity of action is observed, it is
epic unity rather than dramatic. The characters
are little more than puppets that pass across the
stage, moved by no single inward spring of action,
but determined in their movements by outward
forces or temporary emotions.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to this epic profusion of
inchoate external action, we find the authors of
the Senecan tragedies choosing for their material
only the closing portion of the myth which is
the basis of their drama, and centring the little
action they admit around the crisis of a soul's
life, the real subject of their drama being some
spiritual conflict. This introspectiveness, this
interest in spiritual problems and soul processes,
we find in the English drama only after it has
come under the Senecan influence, and it is found
in its most exaggerated form in those dramas
which are most closely modelled after the Senecan
pattern. While the first effect of this influence
was to lessen the dramatic interest, it is only
as the interest in the spiritual life is added to the
wealth of external action that the English drama
finds any true principle of dramatic unity. How
far the stirrings of the Reformation aided in the
development of this interest in soul problems is a
question that the student of dramatic literature
cannot ignore, but which is outside the present
inquiry.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_xv" title="xv"> </a>
The consciousness of the importance to dramatic
art of an inner spiritual theme as a central
formative principle led to the nicer differentiation
of character,&mdash;to the evolution of true dramatic
personages from the puppets of the earlier drama,
through a deeper inquiry into the inward springs
of action.</p>

<p>The centralizing of the visible presentation
around a spiritual theme brought about several
secondary changes in English drama. The narrowing
of the field of action necessitated the
description of past and passing actions, which,
though not admitted on the stage, were necessary
to the understanding of the drama; this led to
the introduction of the stock character of messenger
and of the long descriptive monologues so
familiar in the classic drama. The widening of
the interest in the spiritual conflict necessitated
the objectifying of that conflict, and led to the
introduction of the stock character of confidant,
also well known to the Greek and Roman drama,
and to the further introduction of long and passionate
soliloquy.</p>

<p>This influence exercised by the Senecan tragedies
on the material of the English drama had its
counterpart in an influence on the outward form,&mdash;an
influence no less dominant and abiding. The
tragedies of Seneca are divided, without regard
to their true organic structure, into five acts;
these acts are separated by choruses, that bear
much the same relation to the acts they separate<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xvi" title="xvi"> </a>
as does the orchestral interlude of to-day&mdash;that is,
no real relation; such hard-and-fast division into
five parts by choruses unconnected with the action
is unknown to the Greek drama. The acts are
again divided into scenes, this sub-division being
dependent on the exits and entrances of the <i>dramatis
personæ</i>, every exit and entrance necessitating
a new scene.</p>

<p>The early imitators of Seneca copied their model
closely in the arrangement of acts and scenes, and
with them, as with Seneca, chorus and act division
are wholly unconnected with the action of the
drama; "Gorboduc," "Tancred and Gismunda,"
and "The Misfortunes of Arthur," are the earliest
and most faithful English copies of the Latin
model. In the Shakespearian drama the adherence
to this classic form is less rigid, and the playwright
adds or omits the choruses at will: in
"Henry Fifth," the chorus not only separates the
acts, as in Seneca, but also speaks the prologue;
in "Pericles," where Gower speaks the prologue
and act interludes, there is also added a lyrical
monologue by the same speaker at the opening
of the fourth scene of Act IV.; while in "The
Winter's Tale" the use of a chorus has dwindled
to a single monologue spoken by Time at the
opening of Act IV.</p>

<p>In the later development of the five-act division
the chorus falls away, and the act division
becomes not formal but organic, and coincides with
the structural divisions of introduction, rising<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xvii" title="xvii"> </a>
action, climax, falling action, and catastrophe;
this has now become the rule for the form of the
modern serious drama.</p>

<p>Besides the centralization of the external action
around an inner spiritual theme and the fixing of
the structural form, other less fundamental results
of the Senecan influence are evident in the sixteenth
and seventeenth century English drama. The
Senecan tragedies belong to the age of the Julian
successors of Tiberius,&mdash;an age when reason had
lost its control, when changes were wrought by
intrigue, cunning, and brute force; when vicissitudes
of fortune and enormities of conduct were
witnessed with the same curiosity which is excited
by a fascinating drama, and with something of the
same apathy, even when the spectator himself was
concerned in the exhibition. The effect of this
upon the Senecan tragedy was to expand the
limits of what the dramatic proprieties permitted
to be represented on the stage, to give in place of
dramatic action brilliant and lurid rhetoric only,
and to replace a true philosophy by a stoic fatalism.</p>

<p>The tragic and lurid realism of action and
description which especially differentiate Seneca
from the Greeks found its way into England by
a double stream; that is, not only directly from
his dramas, but also through the channel of contemporary
Italian tragedy, a tragedy which Klein
in his "Geschichte des Dramas" describes as a
horrible caricature of the Senecan tragedy, where<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xviii" title="xviii"> </a>
the pity and fear of the Greeks are turned to
shuddering horror and crocodile tears. The result
is seen in the riot of bloodshed and lust of
the so-called tragedy of blood. What Mr. J. A.
Symonds says of Marlowe's "Tamberlane" is
true of this entire school: "Blood flows in rivers,
shrieks, and groans, and curses mingle with heaven-defying
menaces and ranting vaunts. The
action is one tissue of violence and horror." Even
Shakespeare reflects this influence, and in "Hamlet,"
"Lear," and "Macbeth," we still find this
bloody and sensational tendency, though it is purified
of its worst extravagances.</p>

<p>We have spoken of the two characters of
messenger and confidant which modern drama
owes to the nobler Senecan influence; it is to the
less admirable influence of his sensational realism
that we owe the introduction of supernatural
agencies,&mdash;of witches, ghosts, and apparitions;
these are often little more than stage machinery:
in Shakespeare, however, we find them
transmuted into powerful adjuncts to the dramatic
effect; compare the ghost of Tybalt, that
appears to Juliet when she takes the sleeping potion,
with that of Medea's brother, that appears
to Medea in the last act of the Senecan tragedy
of that name; note, too, the use of the ghost in
"Macbeth," in "Julius Cæsar," and in "Hamlet."</p>

<p>The stoic fatalism which runs like a dark thread
through these tragedies of blood is, in the English<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xix" title="xix"> </a>
as in the Senecan tragedy, the natural concomitant
of all this sensational horror, and is evident in the
texture of the dramas and the character of the
personages, and in original as well as in quoted
passages.</p>

<h3 class="nopage"><a name="DIRECT" id="DIRECT"></a>III<br />
<span class="fontsmall">DIRECT BORROWINGS FROM SENECAN TRAGEDIES</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> need give but little space to remarks upon
the extent to which English dramatists borrowed
directly from the Roman tragedies, for such borrowings
were of far less moment in the evolution
of the modern drama than the more fundamental
imitation of form and structure already noted;
their chief interest indeed lies outside the scope
of dramatic study, and is to be found in the fact
that they serve to mark English sympathy for
certain phases of Roman thought.</p>

<p>The adornment of new tragedies by portions
borrowed from Seneca calls into use most frequently
the phrases which are the expression of a
dark and hopeless philosophy. The fatalism
referred to in preceding lines as characterizing the
Elizabethan tragedies of blood had a strong hold
upon the English mind from a much earlier date.
One need not wonder that the thought which
colored so early a poem as Beowulf, and which
came to the surface in the conscious philosophy
of a later time to reënter literature in the works
of Alexander Pope, should have attracted the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xx" title="xx"> </a>
attention of Englishmen of the sixteenth century
when they found it in a writer of such literary
prestige and philosophic renown as Seneca.</p>

<p>A careful reader of Seneca will recognize the
borrowings of English dramatists the more readily
as such borrowings follow closely not only the
thought but the language of the original.</p>

<p>Mr. John W. Cunliffe, in his monograph on
"The Influence of Seneca on English Tragedy,"
has given a careful and detailed comparison with
their originals of Senecan passages in "The Misfortunes
of Arthur." In a less detailed way he
indicates the borrowings of other English authors;
on pages 25, 26 of his book we find:&mdash;</p>

<p>The student will surmise that phrases of Seneca
can be traced through much of English tragedy,
and that a careful reader is likely to have little
difficulty in bringing together passages inspired
by the Roman tragedies.</p>

<p>A full comparative study of the structural
form of the Senecan and of the early English
regular drama will be found in Rudolf Fischer's
"Kunstentwicklung der Englische Tragödie."
Symonds in his "Shakespeare's Predecessors,"<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xxii" title="xxii"> </a>
and Klein in his "Geschichte des Dramas," also
touch on the debt of the modern drama to the
Roman tragedies.</p>

<p>In the translations that follow, I have endeavored
without doing violence to English idioms
to give a strictly literal translation of the Latin
originals, using as my text the edition of F. Leo.
I wish to express my indebtedness to Prof. Albert
S. Cook, and to Drs. Elisabeth Woodbridge and
M. Anstice Harris, for criticism of the translation,
not only with reference to its fidelity to the original,
but also with regard to its English dress.</p>

<span class="i0">And the Achaians wept the crime they did,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then turned these same Achaians to new crimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to Achilles' tomb. With quiet flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Rh&oelig;tean waters beat the further side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opposite the tomb the level plain                       <span class="linenum">1150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slopes gently upward, and surrounds the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a wide amphitheater; here the strand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is thronged with lookers-on, who think to end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this last death their vessels' long delay,<br /></span><a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>
<span class="i0">And glad themselves to think the foeman's seed              <span class="linenum">1155</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last cut off. The fickle, common crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look coldly on; the most part hate the crime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans haste with no less eagerness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their own funeral rites, and, pale with fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold the final fall of ruined Troy.                       <span class="linenum">1160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As at a marriage, suddenly they bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bridal torches; Helen goes before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attendant to the bride, with sad head bent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'So may the daughter of Hermione<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be wed,' the Phrygians pray, 'base Helen find               <span class="linenum">1165</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again her husband.' Terror seizes both<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The awe-struck peoples. With her glance cast down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Modestly comes the victim; but her cheeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glow, and her beauty shines unwontedly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shines the light of Ph&oelig;bus gloriously                 <span class="linenum">1170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his setting, when the stars return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And day is darkened by approaching night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throng is silenced; all men praise the maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who now must die: some praise her lovely form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tender age moves some, and some lament                  <span class="linenum">1175</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fickleness of fortune; every one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is touched at heart by her courageous soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her scorn of death. She comes, by Pyrrhus led;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All wonder, tremble, pity; when the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is reached, and on his father's grave advanced,             <span class="linenum">1180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young king stands, the noble maid shrinks not,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her unquelled spirit moves the hearts of all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;a new prodigy&mdash;Pyrrhus is slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At slaughter; but at length, with steady hand,              <span class="linenum">1185</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He buries to the hilt the gleaming sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within her breast; the life-blood gushes forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the deep wound; in death as heretofore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her soul is strong; with angry thud she falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she would make the earth a heavy load                    <span class="linenum">1190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon Achilles' breast. Both armies weep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans offer only feeble moans;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victors mourn more freely. So was made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacrifice; her blood lay not for long<br /></span>
